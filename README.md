# 🌌 Geometric Knowledge Representation

## 🚀 Visualizing Knowledge in Multi-Dimensional Spaces

Welcome to the cutting-edge world of Geometric Knowledge Representation! This project pushes the boundaries of how we visualize and interact with complex knowledge structures, transforming abstract concepts into navigable 3D spaces.

### 🌟 Key Features

- **3D Knowledge Graphs**: Witness your ideas come to life in three-dimensional space!
- **Multi-Manifold Projections**: Explore your knowledge on spheres, toroids, and even in hyperbolic space!
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Dive deep into your data with our intuitive, real-time interface.
- **Adaptive Atlases**: Discover hidden connections with our innovative atlas generation system.
- **GNN Integration**: Harness the power of Graph Neural Networks for advanced knowledge processing.

### 🎨 Visualization Types

1. **Euclidean Space**: The classic 3D representation.
2. **Spherical Projection**: Wrap your knowledge around a sphere!
3. **Toroidal Projection**: Explore cyclic relationships in donut-shaped space.
4. **Hyperbolic Projection**: Dive into the infinite depths of hyperbolic geometry.
